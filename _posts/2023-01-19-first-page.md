When I was younger, I used to create a personal homepage. The homepage was about nothing. It literally didn't have any good things. What I only remember was, I just wanted my homepage to be cool, and it failed to be cool. Luckily, I used to own a very simply free domain, so I had several visitors and they visited my homepage for nothing.

As time goes by, I was looking for a easy way to create a personal webpage. Then, finally, I found GitHub has pages and I can build a personal homepage with it. At first, I tried to use HTML style homepage with React. However, since I realized that GitHub pages support markdown, I decided to use markdown. Even a cooler thing is, it acts like a blog post.

I haven't decided what to post on this page, but maybe it can be my daily life or it can be just something that I learn but not want to forget. Now, it begins.

```typescript
const firstMessage = "Hello, welcome to this page!";
```
